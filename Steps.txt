Step 1: If you are using the AWS Organizations feature, ensure the following services are enabled:
    https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/services/CloudTrail
    https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/services/CloudFormation%20StackSets
Step 2: Create a CloudFormation Stack (Ensure you are in your preferred AWS region) using Cyngular's template https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://cyngular-onboarding-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/v3/stacks/CyngularOnBoarding.yaml&stackName=CyngularOnBoarding
Step 3: After the deployment is complete, enter your management account ID and select your preferred regions. Then, click "Connect Cloud Provider"




# a. If the service isn't enabled and you want to enable it, leave the checkbox as "true" â€” no further action is needed.
# b. If the service is already enabled or you don't want to enable it, set the checkbox to "false" during the CloudFormation stack creation. Add the tag to the resource bucket only if your company is already collecting the telemetry and wants Cyngular to analyze it.

#    - Cloud Trail: `{key: "cyngular-cloudtrail", value: "true"}`
#    - DNS Logs: `{key: "cyngular-dnslogs", value: "true"}`
#    - VPC Flow Logs: `{key: "cyngular-vpcflowlogs", value: "true"}`
